# JDocker
Java Docker Client

Docker client in Java that uses tcp or socket. It mapps domain-objects to json and follow Docker Remote API.
Currently only implemented API version 1.24 (Docker 1.12)

The client have support for tcp and unixsocket, Windows namedpipe and test of OSX socket will come.

Most functions have recorded request-response (By Wiremock proxy to docker) and are used in unittest by Wiremock (files and mappings)


## Setting up the client

**Remote Unsecure tcp**
```java
DockerClient client = new DefaultDockerClient("http://127.0.0.1:4243");
```
**Remote secure tcp**
```java
DockerClient client = new DefaultDockerClient("https://127.0.0.1:2376", "/path/to/ssl/certs");
```
**Unix socket**
```java
DockerClient client = new DefaultDockerClient();
```
