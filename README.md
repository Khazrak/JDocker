Docker client in Java that uses tcp or socket. It mapps domain-objects to json and follow Docker Remote API.
Currently only implemented API version 1.24 (Docker 1.12)

Most functions have recorded request-response (By Wiremock proxy to docker) and are used in unittest by Wiremock (files and mappings)
